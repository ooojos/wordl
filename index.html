Let's make a Wordle AI!

I'm obsessed with Wordle.  This is wordle: https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/
It's a guessing game where you try and guess a 5-letter word in 6 attempts getting mastermind style clues along the way.

It's super popular.  And I think there's two main reasons:
-It's fun.  People like feeling smart solving a puzzle.  (I know I'm constantly chasing that high)
-It's easy to share your results spoiler-free.
